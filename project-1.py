# # Project 1: Processing health and activity data [40 marks]
# 
# ---
# 
# Make sure you read the instructions in `README.md` before starting! In particular, make sure your code is well-commented, with sensible structure, and easy to read throughout your notebook.
# 
# ---
# 
# The MMASH dataset [1, 2] is is a dataset of health- and activity-related measurements taken on 22 different people, over a continuous period of 24 hours, using wearable devices.
# 
# In this project, we have provided you with some of this data for **10** of those individuals. In the `dataset` folder, you will find:
# 
# - a file `subject_info.txt` which summarises the age (in years), height (in cm), and weight (in kg) of all 10 study participants,
# - 10 folders named `subject_X`, which each contain two files:
#     - `heartbeats.txt` contains data on all individual heartbeats detected over the 24-hour study period,
#     - `actigraph.txt` contains heart rate and other activity data measured with another device, over the same 24-hour period.
# 
# The tasks below will guide you through using your Python skills to process some of this data. Note that the data was reformatted slightly for the purpose of the assignment (to make your life a bit easier!), but the values are all the original ones from the real dataset.
# 
# ### Getting stuck
# 
# Tasks 3 to 8 follow directly from each other. There is a `testing` folder provided for you with `.npy` files and a supplementary `actigraph.txt` dataset. The `.npy` files are NumPy arrays, which you can load directly using `np.load()`, containing an example of what the data should look like after each task. You will be able to use this example data to keep working on the later tasks, even if you get stuck on an earlier task. Look out for the ðŸ’¾ instructions under each task.
# 
# These were produced using the data for another person which is not part of the 10 you have in your dataset.

# - a NumPy array `info` containing the numerical information for each person (i.e. it should have 10 rows and 4 columns).
# 
# **Important:** the height of each subject should be given in **metres** in your `info` array.

# ## Task 2: Charting the Body Mass Index (BMI) for all participants
# 
# The Body Mass Index (BMI) can be used to indicate whether someone is at a healthy body weight. [The NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/lifestyle/what-is-the-body-mass-index-bmi/) describes it as follows:
# 
# > The body mass index (BMI) is a measure that uses your height and weight to work out if your weight is healthy.
# >
# > The BMI calculation divides an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres, squared. For example, a BMI of $25$ means $25 \text{kg/m}^2$.
# >
# > For most adults, an ideal BMI is in the $18.5$ to $24.9$ range.
# 
# This means that the BMI is calculated as follows:
# 
# $$
# \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight}}{\text{height}^2}.
# $$
# 
# ---
# ðŸš© ***Task 2:*** Write a function `bmi_chart(info)` which takes as input the `info` array returned by `read_subject_info()`, produces a visualisation showing all subjects' heights and weights on a graph, and clearly indicates whether they are within the "healthy weight" range as described above (i.e. their BMI is in the $18.5$ to $24.9$ range).
# 
# Your function should not return anything, but calling it with `bmi_chart(info)` must be sufficient to display the visualisation.
# 
# You should choose carefully how to lay out your plot so that it is easy to interpret and understand.

# ## Task 3: Instantaneous heart rate data
# 
# For each subject, the file `heartbeats.txt` contains data on all individual heartbeats detected over the 24-hour study period. Specifically, the two columns record the time at which each heartbeat was detected, and the interval (in seconds) between the current heartbeat and the previous one.
# 
# ### Handling timestamp data
# 
# For the next tasks, you will use NumPy's `datetime64[s]` and `timedelta64[s]` object types, respectively used to represent times (as if read on a clock) and time intervals. You should [consult the relevant documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.datetime.html#datetimes-and-timedeltas).
# 
# Here are a few illustrative examples:

# %%
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create two datetime objects and a vector of dates
start_time = np.datetime64('2022-10-20 12:00:00')
end_time = np.datetime64('2022-11-10 12:00:00')
time_vector = np.array(['2022-10-20', '2022-10-23', '2022-10-28'], dtype='datetime64[s]')
print(time_vector)

# Get time interval between the two times
time_elapsed = end_time - start_time
print(time_elapsed)
print(type(time_elapsed))

# Divide by the duration of 1 second to get number of seconds (as a number object)
seconds_elapsed = time_elapsed / np.timedelta64(1, 's')
print(seconds_elapsed)
print(type(time_elapsed))

# Divide by the duration of 1 day to get number of days
days_elapsed = time_elapsed / np.timedelta64(1, 'D')
print(days_elapsed)

# Create a range of datetimes spaced by 1 day
step = np.timedelta64(1, 'D')
days = np.arange(start_time, end_time + step, step)

# Plot something using days as the x-axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 4))
value = np.random.randint(1, 11, size=len(days))
ax.plot(days, value, 'ro-')
ax.set(ylim=[0, 11], xlabel='Date', ylabel='Value')

# ## Explanations
# 
# We can see that based on the histgram of raw heart rate data, there are some outliers given the fact that heart rates in adults can typically range from about 40 to 160 beats per minute. In particular, in the plot, there are heart rates being lower than 40 (down to 0) and higher than 160 BPM (up to 250).

# However after cleaning the heart rate data and plot its histgram, it is clearly to see that the heart rates are in the reasonable range (60 to 140 BPM), which means we kind of removed likely measurement errors in the heart rate data by removing the data points that are below the prc_lowth percentile and above the prc_highth percentile.

# ## Task 5: Interpolating the data
# 
# Although the device detecting heartbeats was able to measure intervals between beats with millisecond precision, the recorded timestamps could only record the second at which a heartbeat occurred. This means that there are not only time gaps in the data (due to the device missing heartbeats), but also several heartbeats usually recorded in the same second.
# 
# For example, this is an excerpt from Subject 7's data, showing a 9-second time gap between `09:19:57` and `09:20:06`, as well as 3 different heartbeats detected at `09:20:06`:
# 
# ```
# 59,2022-07-21 09:19:56,1.033
# 60,2022-07-21 09:19:57,0.942

# 64,2022-07-21 09:20:07,0.427
# ```
# 
# The goal of this next task is to **interpolate** the recorded data, in order to produce a new dataset containing values of the heart rate at regular time intervals. We will use **linear interpolation**, with the help of SciPy's `interp1d()` function (from the `interpolate` module) which we saw in Week 5.
#

# - Write a few lines of test code which clearly demonstrate how the functions work.

# 
# This plot is what I expected, since we can see that the interpolated heart rate data captures the whole trend in the original cleaned heart rate data in general with a few extreme data points being missed.

# ## Task 6: Smoothing the data with a rolling average
# 
# A rolling average is simply an average of the heart rate data, calculated over a given window of time. For example:
# 
# - The 20-second rolling average of the heart rate at a time `10:20:00` is the average heart rate over the 20 seconds leading up to that time, i.e. the average of all the heart rates between `10:19:41` and `10:20:00` (inclusive). If we have measurements of the heart rate every 5 seconds, then this would be the average of the heart rates measured at `10:19:45`, `10:19:50`, `10:19:55`, and `10:20:00`.
# - We can similarly calculate the 20-second rolling average at the next measurement time, `10:20:05`, as the average heart rate over the 20-second period from `10:19:46` to `10:20:05` (inclusive).
# 
# The rolling average essentially smoothes out the sudden jumps in the measured (or interpolated) heart rate data, allowing us to see the longer-term variations more clearly.
# 
# ---
# ðŸš© ***Task 6:*** Write a function `rolling_average()` which takes as inputs:
# 
# - two NumPy vectors `times` and `hr` such as those returned by `clean_data()`,
# - a `timedelta64[s]` object `time_delta` representing a time interval in seconds,
# - a `timedelta64[s]` object `window`, representing the window duration in seconds (with `window` assumed to be an integer multiple of `time_delta`),
# 
# and returns a NumPy vector `hr_rolling` containing values for the rolling average of the heart rate over time, with the given window size.
# 
# Your `rolling_average()` function should call `generate_interpolated_hr()` to generate regularly-spaced heart rate data with a time interval `time_delta`, before computing and returning the averaged heart rate data.
# 
# Note that `hr_rolling` will be shorter than the length of your interpolated heart rate data, because you can only start computing rolling averages after one window of time has elapsed. (For instance, if your data starts at `10:20:00`, with a 30-second window, the first value of the rolling average you can obtain is at `10:20:29`.)

# Basically, I write a function to display the plot for presentation. An example has been showed by using this function to display the plots for subject 8, 1% and 99% percentile, 3s as an example. And I used 1000 data points in order to better visualise the results.

# ## Conclusion
# 
# Overall, we can see that the range of the heart rate when a subject is standing is slightly larger than that when he/she is sitting and lying or, I shall say that the data is more concentrated in high values for a standing subject than a sitting and lying subject wnen their data ranges are pretty much the same. Also, it is clear that the difference in the range of the heart rate data when sitting and lying is not that significant. 
# 
# However, some unusual occasions happen: the data range is larger when a subject is lying than standing. It is reasonable anyway since this is a rough assumption.
